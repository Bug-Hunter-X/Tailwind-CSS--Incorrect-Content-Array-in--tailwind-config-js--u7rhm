```javascript
// ...your Tailwind CSS configuration...
module.exports = {
  // ...other configurations...
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'], // <-- This line might be problematic
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // ...your custom theme configurations...
    }
  },
  plugins: []
}
```
This configuration might lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the `content` array does not accurately represent all the files that contain Tailwind CSS directives. If you're using a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, this usually isn't a problem because the build process automatically handles including the necessary files.

However, if you are working with a custom setup or monorepo, make sure the content array is correct and up-to-date.
