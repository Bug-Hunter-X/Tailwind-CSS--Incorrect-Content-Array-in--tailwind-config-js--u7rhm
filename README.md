# Tailwind CSS Incorrect Content Array Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in Tailwind CSS configurations.  The problem stems from an incorrectly configured `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  This array tells Tailwind where to look for your CSS directives, and if it's wrong, Tailwind might not find your classes, resulting in styling errors or missing styles.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  (If you use yarn, run `yarn install`.)
3. Run a build or development server as appropriate for your framework (e.g. `npm run dev`).
4. Observe the resulting styles on your application.  Note the missing or incorrectly applied styles.

## Solution

The bug is fixed by ensuring that the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` correctly points to all files that contain Tailwind CSS classes.  Make sure you adjust the paths in the array to match your project structure.  Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected configuration.

## Additional Notes

In projects with a more complex structure, you'll want to thoroughly check for completeness in the content array, potentially using globs to ensure you capture all relevant files. Consult the Tailwind CSS documentation for the most up-to-date best practices.
